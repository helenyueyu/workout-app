This is an app which allows you to select a random exercise (e.g. jumping jacks, squats, push-ups) to add to your daily routine. There are four difficulty levels which determine the quantity of exercise (e.g. 5 vs. 15 push-ups). There is also a timer which records how long it takes for you to complete the exercise.
